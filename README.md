Preprint Template Class
=======================

This project contains a preprint template created by Steffen W. R. Werner for
consistent writing of research papers in LaTeX.
It yields a suitable default for preprints uploaded to open servers like arXiv
and may be used for that purpose.


## Dependencies and Installation

To use the `preprint.cls` file in your projects, it must be in the search path
of your LaTeX compiler, e.g., in the same directory as the LaTeX file in which
you call this class file.

This LaTeX class builds upon the KOMA-Script class `scrartcl`.
Additionally, the following standard packages with pre-set options are
automatically loaded:
* algorithm
* algorithm2e
* algpseudocode
* amsmath
* authblk
* cite
* cleveref
* doi
* geometry
* hyperref
* lineno
* scrlayer-scrpage
* scrdate
* url
* xcolor


## Getting Started

The documentation of the class can be found in `example.tex` in form of an
example preprint article and precompiled for visualization in
`example_onecolumn.pdf` and `example_twocolumn.pdf`.
